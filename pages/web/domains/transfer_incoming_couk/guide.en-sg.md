## Objective

Transferring a .uk (or similar) domain name requires a specific approach.

**This guide explains how to transfer a .uk (or similar) domain name to OVHcloud.**

## Requirements

- Your domain must not be in the Redemption period or Pending Delete status.
- The domain must not be blocked by your registrar.
- Owner contact information must be up to date in the [Whois](https://www.nominet.uk/whois){.external} data of the domain.
- You are able to obtain the authorisation code that will be sent to the domain owner's email address. 

## Extensions in question

- .co.uk
- .me.uk
- .org.uk
- .ltd.uk
- .plc.uk
- .uk

## Instructions

### Step 1: Changing your domain TAG

In order to transfer your domain to OVHcloud, you must first specify the OVHcloud TAG at your current registrar: "OVH-FR". The list of TAGs for the different registrars is available on the official [Nominet](http://www.nominet.uk/registrar-list){.external} registry website.


> [!primary]
>
> If you cannot change your domain's TAG through your current registrar, you can apply to the Nominet registry to make the change for you. Nominet will charge a fee for this service.
> Please refer to [Nominet's website](https://www.nominet.uk/domain-support/){.external} for more information. 
>

### Step 2: Obtaining the authorisation code

After you change the TAG, the domain name owner will receive an authorisation code (authcode) by email after a few minutes. This is valid for 5 days and required to initiate the (free) domain transfer order at OVHcloud.

### Step 3: Ordering the free transfer

Once you have your authorisation code, you can create the transfer order for your domain name on the OVHcloud [website](https://www.ovh.co.uk/). This order is similar to that of a generic domain name.

Your domain will then be available in your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager) within a few hours.

### Additional information

#### Cost of a .uk domain transfer (or similar)

The transfer is free.

#### Authorisation code validity

The authorisation code is generated automatically as a result of the modification of the TAG. If the order is not made within 5 days, the transfer will be cancelled by the registrar.

#### Domain renewal due to transfer

The transfer being free, the domain's expiry date after changing registrars will be the same as before. To renew a domain after the transfer, you can create a renewal order on the [OVHcloud website](https://www.ovh.co.uk/cgi-bin/order/renew.cgi).
