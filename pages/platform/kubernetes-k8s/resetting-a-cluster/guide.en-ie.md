## Objective

OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes service provides you Kubernetes clusters without the hassle of installing or operating them. 

**Find out how to reset an OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes cluster.**


## Requirements

- an OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes cluster


## Instructions

### Step 1 - Ask for cluster reset on the OVH Cloud Manager 

Access our administration UI for your OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes clusters by clicking on the *Platforms and services* menu in the Public Cloud section of the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/manager/cloud/)

In the *Services* tab of the administration UI, click on the button on the *Status* section, and choose to reset the configuration of the cluster.

### Step 2 - Choose the type of reset you want

You have two options on the reset menu, *Delete* and *Reinstall*. 

- Choosing *Delete* means that the current cluster nodes are deleted, and the cluster is reinitialized to an empty state.

- Choosing *Reinstall* means that the cluster is reinitialized without destroying the nodes.

### Step 3 - Wait for the resetting to end 

Depending on the chosen kind of reset, the process can take several minutes. During that time, a message on the manager warns you that the cluster is under resetting:
