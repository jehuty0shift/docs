In this tutorial we are going to guide you in using images from OVHcloud Managed Private Registry service on OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes clusters.

## Before you begin

This tutorial presupposes that you already have a working OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes cluster, and some basic knowledge of how to operate it. If you want to know more on those topics, please look at the [deploying a Hello World application](../../kubernetes/deploying-hello-ovh/) documentation.

You also need to have a working OVHcloud Managed Private Registry and have followed the guides on [creating a private registry](../creating-a-private-registry/), [connecting to the UI](../connecting-to-the-ui/), [managing users and projects](../managing-users-and-projects/) and [creating and using private images](../creating-and-using-a-private-image/).

We will specifically suppose you have followed the last one and you have a `hello-ovh` image on your private registry.

## Deploying using a Secret based on existing Docker credentials

### Login into your OVHcloud Managed Private Registry

In order to pull a private image from you private registry, you must authenticate with it using `docker login`.


```bash
docker login [YOUR_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_URL]
```

In my private registry example:

<pre class="console"><code>
  $ docker login 8093ff7x.gra5.container-registry.ovh.net
  Authenticating with existing credentials...

  Login Succeeded
</code></pre>

The login process creates or updates a `config.json` file that holds an authorization token.

View the `config.json` file:

```bash
cat ~/.docker/config.json
```


### Creating the Secret

Needing to do a `docker login` can get annoying quickly, so let's do it in another way: by storing the registry credentials on the Kubernetes cluster in Secret of `docker-registry` type. You will use this Secret to authenticate with your private registry to pull a private image.

If you already ran `docker login`, you can copy that credential into Kubernetes:

```
kubectl create secret generic regcred \
    --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path/to/.docker/config.json> \
    --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```

In my private registry example:

<pre class="console"><code>
  $ kubectl create secret generic regcred \
  >   --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=/home/horacio/.docker/config.json \
  >   --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
  secret/regcred created
</code></pre>


### To deploy an image we need a manifest

The first step to deploy a Docker image in a Kubernetes cluster is to write a YAML manifest. Let's call it `hello-ovh.yaml`:


```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-ovh
  labels:
    app: hello-ovh
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
    name: http
  selector:
    app: hello-ovh
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-ovh-deployment
  labels:
    app: hello-ovh
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-ovh
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-ovh
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-ovh
        image: [YOUR_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_URL]/private/hello-ovh:1.0.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: regcred
```


And then we can apply the file:

```bash
kubectl apply -f hello-ovh.yaml
```

After applying the YAML file, a new `hello-world` service and the corresponding `hello-world-deployment` deployment are created:

<pre class="console"><code>
  $ kubectl apply -f hello-ovh.yaml
  service/hello-ovh created
  deployment.apps/hello-ovh-deployment created
</code></pre>
